# Decision Making Loops

# Loops
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times

# While loop
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

# For loop
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

# Do...while loop
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.

# Nested loops
It can be used as one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.

# Break statement
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
