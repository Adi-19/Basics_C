# Aim 

Aim : Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the
following operationson STACK ofIntegers (Array Implementation of Stack with maximum size MAX)

1. Push an Element on to Stack
2. Pop an Element from Stack
3. Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome
4. Demonstrate Overflow andUnderflow situations on Stack
5. Display the statusof Stack
6. Exit

# Theory:
A stack is a data structure that holds a list of elements. A stack works based on the LIFO principle
i.e.,Last In, First out, meaningthat the most recentlyadded element isthe first one to remove.
A stack hastwo main operationsthat occur only at the top ofthe stack:
push and pop. 

# Push () method:
The push operation places an element at the top of stack where as the pop operation removes an elementfrom the topofthe stack.
The push ()method allows you to add one ormore elementsto the end of the array. 
The push ()method returnsthe value ofthe length property that specifiesthe number of elementsin the array.
